	<p style="font-size: 2.2vw;">Brooklyn Web Design & Wordpress Development</p>
	<p style="line-height: 2.2; opacity: 0.7; text-align: center; max-width: 1100px; width: 100%;">Being that I only work with a select amount of clients at once, Iâ€™m able to provide agency service, without the agency price.  I enjoy working with local businesses within the Brooklyn area, as well as some of my previous tech startups stretching as far as Spain to London. Whether you're looking to improve your current website or completely start fresh, it's worth a quick conversation to see what I could offer you.</p>
